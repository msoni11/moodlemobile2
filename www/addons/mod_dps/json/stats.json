Indeed, there are those who are serious and diligent in their material affairs, but are quite weak when it comes to spiritual matters.<br /><br /> Choice (c) is incorrect as well. Faith helps us to exercise willpower in the spiritual domain. Thus, the stronger our faith, the stronger our willpower becomes, provided that our faith is sincere. There are those who appear to have faith on the surface, but don’t draw upon it in their spiritual lives, despite exercising sufficient willpower in their material lives and in the fulfillment of their terrestrial desires. </div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"r0 lastrow\">\n<td class=\"cell c0 lastcol\" style=\"text-align:left;width:60%;\">Points for this submission: 0 / 100</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n"
